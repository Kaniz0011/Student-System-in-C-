# Student-System-in-C++

# Question:
You have recently joined TechVision Pvt. Ltd. as a Junior Software Developer. The company is building a Student Information System (SIS) to manage student records efficiently. Your team lead has asked you to design and implement a small prototype using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.
Your task is to demonstrate how the OOP paradigm helps in organizing real-world entities like students into classes and objects while applying the concepts of encapsulation, constructors, destructors, and abstraction.
Requirements:
  Create a class named Student that represents a student in the system.
  Use private attributes: name, age, rollNo, and gpa.
  Define public methods for:
Setting and displaying student information.
Calculating and displaying the student’s grade based on GPA.
  Implement constructors:
A default constructor initializes default values.
A parameterized constructor that accepts and sets all attributes.
  Add a destructor that displays a message when an object is destroyed.
  Apply encapsulation by using getter and setter methods.
  Demonstrate constructor overloading and default arguments where appropriate.
  Show object creation and method calls for at least three students using different constructors.


  Separate your code into three files:
Student.h → Class declaration
Student.cpp → Function implementation
main.cpp → Object creation and testing
  Draw a UML Class Diagram for the Student class showing:
Class name, attributes, and methods
Proper visibility symbols (+ for public, – for private)
  Add comments in your code to explain each major concept used (e.g., encapsulation, abstraction).
  Output should be clear, well-formatted, and meaningful (e.g., “Name: Ali | Age: 20 | Grade: A”).
